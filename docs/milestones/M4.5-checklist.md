# Milestone 4.5 Checklist (User Bubble Playback)

## Goal

Verify user voice messages appear as playable chat bubbles with STT text displayed in the bubble.

## Setup

1. Start API and web as in M4.
2. Open app and make sure WS is connected.

## Pass/Fail Tests

1. Voice bubble creation
- Record audio and wait for STT to fill input.
- Click `Send`.
- User bubble should render as a voice bubble (not plain text only).

2. Play button behavior
- Voice bubble shows a `[▶]` play button.
- Click once to play; icon should switch to stop (`■`) while playing.
- Click again to stop/reset.

3. STT text shown in bubble
- Voice bubble should show an `STT:` line below the main text.
- `STT:` content should match recognized transcription.

4. Multiple voice messages
- Send two voice messages.
- Playback should work for each message.
- Starting one playback should stop any currently playing message.

5. Existing text-only flow unchanged
- Send a normal typed message (no new recording).
- It should remain a plain text bubble without voice controls.

## Exit Criteria

Milestone 4.5 is done only if all five tests pass.
